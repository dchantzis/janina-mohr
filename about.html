  from 2007 to 2010 Janina went to École Superieure des arts et techniques de la Mode, ESMOD Berlin. During her studies she lived in Copenhagen interning at WOOD WOOD where she gained hands on experience designing and making patterns for WOOD WOOD's womens line as well as technical drawings for AS 10/11.

  In the summer 2010, Janina´s journey took her to New York where she assumed control of the pattern division of TIM HAMILTON's mens wear.

  In winter 2011, Janina supported the Munich based label PATRICK MOHR as a design assistant in Womens Wear and Accessories and took on the job of technical drawer for AW 11/12 as well as SS 12.

  since may 2011, Janina is living and working in Berlin as a freelance designer, pattern maker and technical drawer.

  her latest passion took her into fashion short films.
